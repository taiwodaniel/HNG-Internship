                    <h3><span>Education</span></h3>
                    <p>I am currently a 100 level student of Computer Science at the University of Ibadan. I finished my 
                        Secondary School education from Clemmy High School, Lagos State and I do believe that I have been equipped 
                        with the necessary social and soft skills required to work effectively in a team made up of people I am 
                        too familiar with.

                    <h3><span>Skills</span></h3>
                    <p>I currently have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but am willing to learn more about front-end 
                        development as I progress in this internship. I am also a digital illustrator and designer who loves 
                        to create amazing illustrations and designs for companies and individuals.

                    <h3><span>Experience</span></h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I do not have any experience with working with a team on a project. I do have some experience with 
                        building model sites on my own(for learning purposes of course). This is the main reason I joined this internship(i.e 
                        to connect with new individuals, learn how to work well with a team, build cool projects, and enhance my front-end developer
                        skills).
